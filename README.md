# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

It's a simple CLI program that tells you how many words there are in a .txt file and how many times each character appears!

## HOW TO RUN IT 

1. Clone this repo
2. CD into the folder
3. Run python3 main.py + relative_path_to_your_book
4. Ta-da!
